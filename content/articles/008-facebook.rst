If you havent heard yet, Facebook will be hosting a Hackathon on Saturday, 15
March 2014. A Hackathon is a (codefest) event where computer programmers and
others involved in software development, graphic designers, interface
designers and project managers collaborate intensively on software
projects.Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the
programming language used, the operating, an application, an API, or the
subject and the demographic group of the programmer. Though for the Facebook
hackthon, there isnt any restriction on what you can make so aim for the sky.
