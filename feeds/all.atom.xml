on the internet here is an interesting topic that comes up, the aspect of online
anonymity. Anonymous apps such as Whisper and Secret have made us aware of the
issues we face in the modern world, reigniting the debate as to whether
anonynmity outweights the risk it comes with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important topic beyond tech, a question of how humans should treat one
another: Can we improve ourselves? Do we want to? Do we have a moral obligation
to do so? People in tech are outstanding at building, but at moderating? There
we don’t have much of a track record. Even the likes of Facebook have not been
able to control that and make favourable decisions most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People are people, and will exhibit bad behaviour almost anywhere so it's more
of an individual choice. We have soldiers in Afghanistan, who might not have
proper resources to get the emotional support they need during combat. This
platform act as a medium to express feelings. Anonymity facilitates the
feeling of &amp;quot;I'm not the only one out there...&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like any other platform there are bound to be issues which we have no control
over, such systems will always get users. But to what end, and at what cost.
Sometimes it depends individually such that our personality defines who we
really are and what we end up doing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all have a story to share, and most of the times we learn from our mistakes
but I believe we can learn from other people's mistakes too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The facts are laid out but I think it's all about making the right choice by
figuring out if the positive aspects of this ideas outweigh the negative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who'd like to give it a try, you can visit &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.secret.ly"&gt;Secret&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://whisper.sh"&gt;Whisper&lt;/a&gt; to get a better understanding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a basic &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;&lt;span class="pre"&gt;~/.gitconfig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; file that sets you name, sets up aliases and
enables highlighting in git output:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class="literal-block"&gt;
[user]
    name = Dmitrijs Milajevs
    email = dimazest&amp;#64;gmail.com
[color]
    diff = auto
    status = auto
    branch = auto
    ui = auto
    decorate = short
[alias]
    st = status
    ci = commit
    br = branch
    co = checkout
    unstage = reset HEAD --
    last = log -1 HEAD
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can type &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git st&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt class="docutils literal"&gt;git status&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Skogmo</name></author><id>tag:qmcs.github.io,2014-03-04:a-small-markdown-introduction.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Giving writers a WYSIWYG makes the assumption that they know how to make stuff
look good. This is wrong. People who work with words should only have to care
about words. Leaving the design choices to the designers. Markdown does an
excellent job in accomplishing this compromise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of the web's most populare publishing tools are now supporting Markdown.
And you might recognise it from Stack Overflow and GitHub. So maybe it's time
you get down with the M-down?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How the hell do you harvest the sweet markdown nectar? Easy. Kick-start your
favourite (plain)text editor and fire away. Since Markdown is a lightweight
markup language, all of you oldschool BBCode forum writers out there will find
yourselves quite confortable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though you can find the reference to &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax"&gt;Markdown's
syntax&lt;/a&gt; online, I'll walk
you through some of the basics. Do note that there is alternatives for some of
the elements, so I encourouge you to gaze over the documenation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Headers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use hashtags to mark the level of a header.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="c"&gt;# This is an H1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;## This is an H2&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c"&gt;### This is an H3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Emphasis&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asterisks or underlines&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;The&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;quick&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;brown&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;fox&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;jumps&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;over&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lazy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;dog&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;**&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becomes "The quick &lt;em&gt;brown fox&lt;/em&gt; jumps over the &lt;strong&gt;lazy dog&lt;/strong&gt;"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Links&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are multiple ways of making links in MD, either inline or by reference.
However here is the most used way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;an&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;](&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;http&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;//example.com &amp;quot;Title&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Lists&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply use something that looks listy (*, + or -).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Unordered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Ordered&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(What the numbers are does't matter)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Red&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Green&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;4.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Blue&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Becomes&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Red&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Green&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Inline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use the backtick quotes (`) for &lt;code&gt;inline code&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Block&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;4 spaces or 1 tab indention&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HAI&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.2&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;CAN&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;HAS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;STDIO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;VISIBLE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;HAI WORLD!!!1!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;KTHXBYE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

of certain kinds of software. Anything from modelling the environment, to a
lottery machine, to determining the value of loot in a chest in an RPG, will
require random number generation. At first it may seem strange that computers,
which are capable of producing massive amounts of digits in a short time,
would not be able to produce random numbers. The difficulty is that the
computers we use, are constructed specifically to follow logical steps
deterministically, so to generate numbers that are truly random from a system
like our computers is virtually impossible. True randomness cannot be obtained
using arithmetic operations, which is exactly what our computers perform. When
some sequence of numbers is random then it is not possible to predict what the
next digit will be, and since computers use a set of logical steps to create
any new number it is theoretically possible to predict it. Nonetheless
programmers take advantage of features for creating random numbers all the
time, the most widely used programming languages, provide libraries that can
generate 'random' values. Any role-playing game for example, that you might
use, needs random values to determine the number of gold you'll find from some
locations, what items dead enemies will drop, etc. So how is it possible that
even though the very nature of computers makes it impossible to exhibit random
behaviour, that many programs include simulations of randomness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer is pseudo-random number generators(PRNG), these are programs that
follow a certain algorithm to simulate random behaviour. The numbers they
generate, cannot be by definition truly random, however for many uses it is a
good enough approximation. The libraries in many of todays programming
languages that generate random digits use PRNG's. The basic idea is to perform
some arithmetic operations on a number in sequence, to make it seem like it's
random. A PRNG always starts with an initial value called a seed. It will then
perform operations on the seed to make the final number different from the
original value. So when the PRNG is supplied with seeds that are in sequence,
it will return numbers that seem random, because the operations that are
performed on each number should change it to make it so the returned numbers
are no longer following any pattern. PRNG's are also periodical, they have a certain
amount of numbers they produce, and after that the sequence starts to repeat
itself. It is usually not a problem to make the period very large, so that the
application that relies on it will never start to get repeated sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very well known PRNG is the Mersenne Twister(1), it is the default PRNG for
Python, Ruby, PHP and many others. It has a period of 2^(19937−1), which is a
Mersenne prime number, hence the name of the generator. Invented in 1997 it
was largely superior to PRNG's like C's rand or Java's Random. Furthermore it
passes certain statistical tests for randomness so it is a very reliable
generator as it is very successful at simulating genuine randomness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These programs have been used extensively and are relied upon by many applications,
it is important to note that when truly random behaviour is needed then PRNG's
are not sufficient. John von Neumann famously said: “Anyone who considers
arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of
sin.&amp;quot; In this situation he was referring to depending on PRNG's or other
arithmetic approaches to create truly random digits, which is not a good idea.
Rather it is possible to use true random number generators, that are based on
the idea of extracting physical phenomena that are believed to be random and
using them to generate random numbers. For example atmospheric noise, or
radioactive decay, etc. Even though it is possible to extract truly random
numbers from the outside world, most applications that use random numbers use
PRNG's. It is because of their convenience, there is no need for any extra
devices, or input, all it needs is a sequence of numbers that it later
transforms into a pseudo-random sequence.&lt;/p&gt;

March 2014. A Hackathon is a (codefest) event where computer programmers and
others involved in software development, graphic designers, interface
designers and project managers collaborate intensively on software
projects.Hackathons tend to have a specific focus, which can include the
programming language used, the operating, an application, an API, or the
subject and the demographic group of the programmer. Though for the Facebook
hackthon, there isnt any restriction on what you can make so aim for the sky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So Join Facebook in London as we stay up all night hacking, learning and
having a some fun! Start brainstorming ideas &amp;amp; forming teams (of up to 4
people). Facebook will suply us with  food, fun diversions, prizes, and some
expert guidance in the form of our engineers. Travel will be reimbursed for
public transportation.You bring your laptop, appetite, skills and ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The winning team will get the chance to compete against teams from other
Hackathons both domestically and internationally at the Hackathon Finals and
be judged by Facebook executives -- held at Facebook HQ in Menlo Park,
California in November!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a link for registration
&lt;a class="reference external" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/londonhackathon"&gt;https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/londonhackathon&lt;/a&gt;. Register before the 4th of

&lt;h2&gt;PyData in London&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydata.org/ldn2014"&gt;PyData&lt;/a&gt; is a conference dedicated to the scientific tools in Python. London is
the first city outside the U.S. that hosts the conference on February 21 - 23.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This time several &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://pydata.org/ldn2014/news/"&gt;diversity scholarships&lt;/a&gt; are offered. Here is the
announcement from the conference page:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the goals of PyData is to increase awareness and excitement around
opportunities for women and underrepresented groups in software engineering.
To increase diversity in scientific computing, our outreach programmes range
from hosting workshops to introduce programming to young women, to encouraging
diversity in speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For PyData London 2014, we are offering scholarship opportunities to women and
those from other underrepresented groups who may otherwise be unable to attend
the conference. Generous donations from the Python Software Foundation and
NumFocus have made these efforts possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To apply for a scholarship, please fill out our &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Ke-RVO09nDgZBls6zt0PDpNLRGczykRB-cRTwrRReqk/viewform"&gt;application&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="section" id="europython-in-berlin"&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Europython in Berlin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Europython is a largest Python related event in Europe. It's usually running
for a week. This year the conference will be in Berlin, Germany, on July 21 -
27.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is possible to get early bit tickets with a student discount, you just need
to &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.europython.eu/post/74824001195/the-early-bird-ticket-sale-will-start-soon-special"&gt;send your student ID&lt;/a&gt;. Grants should be announced soon, so read their
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://blog.europython.eu"&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt; or follow &lt;a class="reference external" href="https://twitter.com/europython"&gt;&amp;#64;europython&lt;/a&gt;. See you in Berlin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

a software engineering project, but first, you do something useful, second,
you get a lot of support from professional developers (so you are not alone
trying to configure SVN and NetBeans), and you get paid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So far the program is in early stage, the list of accepted projects &lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/events/google/gsoc2014"&gt;will be
published on February 24&lt;/a&gt;. However, it's a good idea to go trough the
&lt;a class="reference external" href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/projects/list/google/gsoc2013"&gt;project list of 2013&lt;/a&gt; to get an idea of possible projects and good
